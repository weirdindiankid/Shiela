# Shiela
An automated post scheduler for Facebook pages.

Important:

This application needs the following PEAR repository to run:

<a href="http://pear.php.net/package/System_Daemon">PHP System Daemon</a>

Once you have installed this, follow the steps below:

1. Change the variable names to reflect your App ID and your App secret.

2. Change the uploaddir variables to reflect your upload directory.

3. Move the file named 'shiela' to /usr/local/bin

The code here is horribly written and I plan on cleaning it up sometime in the future.
Feel free to fork this repo and make something better.
